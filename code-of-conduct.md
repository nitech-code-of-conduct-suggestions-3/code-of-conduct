NI Tech & Design Code of Conduct
================================

Welcome!
--------

The NI Tech and Design Slack (or NI Tech Slack) is a gathering of people working in the tech and design fields with an association to Northern Ireland. The group is not restricted to people who work in these fields, or who live in Northern Ireland.

The current admin is Maurice Kelly (@mo).

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Confidentiality:
----------------

**Please keep what's said in the NI Tech Slack confidential**. Don't repeat or quote things said here without the affirmative consent of the speaker(s). When quoting (with consent), please be careful not to reveal the existence of the NI Tech Slack. Rather, you can refer to the quote as something that was said "in chat" or while you were talking to the quoted member.

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**. While we expect members to honor the confidentiality of this space, we cannot guarantee that they will do so--nor can we guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Logs and Records:
-----------------

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**. We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this slack. We also can't guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Message Retention:
------------------

Because this is a free slack account, the ability to scroll back is limited, but Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of the NI Tech Slack. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.

Harassment:
-----------

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

Reporting
---------

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Accountability
--------------

To help ensure consistency and transparency of enforcement, a rotating group of three non-admins will form an accountability panel. They will be expected to ensure that the Code of Conduct is enforced fairly, according to its terms and without partiality to any individual, group or community within the Slack, either intended or in practice. They do not provide any route of appeal, and have no powers beyond requesting improvements from admins and relating their findings to the rest of the community, during and/or at the end of their term.

To fill these roles, once a quarter, three public channels (with active history) will be randomly selected and one non-admin user randomly selected, with posts in the visible history of Slack (not necessarily that channel). The process is repeated in each channel until a user agrees and the number of rejections for a given channel is recorded (without user details), as part of accountability reporting. If no user in a channel agrees, this is recorded and a new channel picked at random.

Admins will relate any invocation of the Code of Conduct, and (as far as practical without personal identifiability) details of any implicit/explicit request for enforcement to the accountability panel. Any individuals or groups who believe they have not been treated fairly may report their rationale to the panel, for inclusion in accountability reporting, while recognising that the accountability panel may not use their roles to influence any specific admin decision. As part of their reporting, the accountability panel will provide a short summary at the end of the quarter, highlighting any outstanding concerns, with basic rationale, in the #general channel.

Panelists must expressly agree to maintain anonymity of anyone contacting them in this capacity, as a condition of acceptance, and not to relay any information to the admins that has been passed in confidence, except where legally required or where forming part of abusive behaviour towards the panelists. Panelists are expected to treat any issue raised to them in good faith impartially, regardless of their own perspective, agreement or disagreements.

This role is expected to involve, on average, 0.5-1.5h work per person per quarter.

Consequences
------------

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.
